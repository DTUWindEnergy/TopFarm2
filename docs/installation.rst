Installation Guide
===========================

Pre-Installation
----------------------------
Before you can install the software, you must first have a working Python distribution with a package manager. For all platforms we recommend that you download and install Anaconda - a professional grade, full-blown scientific Python distribution.

To set up Anaconda, you should:

    * Download and install Anaconda (Python 3.x version, 64 bit installer is recommended) from https://www.continuum.io/downloads
    
    * Update the root Anaconda environment (type in a terminal): 
        
        ``>> conda update --all``
    
    * Activate the Anaconda root environment in a terminal as follows: 
        
        ``>> activate``

It is recommended to create a new environment to install TOPFARM if you have other Python programs. This ensures that the dependencies for the different packages do not conflict with one another. In the command prompt, create and active an environment with::

   conda create --name topfarm "python<3.12"
   conda activate topfarm

Simple Installation
----------------------------

TOPFARMâ€™s base code is open-sourced and freely available on `GitLab 
<https://gitlab.windenergy.dtu.dk/TOPFARM/TopFarm2>`_ (MIT license).

* Install from PyPi.org (official releases)::

    pip install topfarm

* Install from GitLab  (includes latest updates, use with caution as it may contain bugs)::

    pip install git+https://gitlab.windenergy.dtu.dk/TOPFARM/TopFarm2.git

* If your workflow requires `tensorflow`, you can install TOPFARM with an extra::

    pip install topfarm[tensorflow]

Developer Installation
-------------------------------

We highly recommend developers to install TOPFARM into the environment created previously. The commands to clone and install TOPFARM with developer options into the current active environment in an Anaconda Prompt are as follows::

   git clone https://gitlab.windenergy.dtu.dk/TOPFARM/TopFarm2.git
   cd TopFarm2
   pip install -e .

Basic Examples
===============

These examples are a collection of Jupyter notebooks for demonstrating bits
of code. You can look at them in your web browser, or if you click on the
"Try this yourself" link at the top of the page, you can run the notebook
off of your personal Google account. Alternatively, the source code for the
notebooks is `here on GitLab <https://gitlab.windenergy.dtu.dk/TOPFARM/TopFarm2/tree/master/docs/notebooks>`_.

You can also `launch them via Binder <https://mybinder.org/v2/git/https%3A%2F%2Fgitlab.windenergy.dtu.dk%2FTOPFARM%2FTopFarm2.git/HEAD>`_ where no user account is required.

In this section, only the most basic components of TOPFARM are explained. In addition to the tutorial, the user can play around with the parameters in each notebook to see how these influence the results.

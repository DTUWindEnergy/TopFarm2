Advanced Examples
===================

These examples are a collection of Jupyter notebooks for demonstrating bits
of code. You can look at them in your web browser, or if you click on the
"Try this yourself" link at the top of the page, you can run the notebook
off of your personal Google account. Alternatively, the source code for the
notebooks is `here on GitLab <https://gitlab.windenergy.dtu.dk/TOPFARM/TopFarm2/tree/master/docs/notebooks>`_.

You can also `launch them via Binder <https://mybinder.org/v2/git/https%3A%2F%2Fgitlab.windenergy.dtu.dk%2FTOPFARM%2FTopFarm2.git/HEAD>`_ where no user account is required.

In this section, more complex configurations for wind farm optimization are shown. These allow the user to get insights into TOPFARM's capabilities when it comes to solving challenging optimization problems.

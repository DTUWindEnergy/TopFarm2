Influence of wind turbine size on Levelized Cost of Energy of the offshore wind farm Energy Island Bornholm
===============================================================================================================

**Abstract**

This study investigates how wind turbine sizes ranging from 8 MW to 22 MW affect wind
farm layouts and the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) for the Energy Island Bornholm project
in Denmark. This is accomplished by utilizing and expanding the heuristic optimization algorithm
called Smart-Start, which is part of the TOPFARM optimization tool. The analysis evaluates
three predefined wind farm sites, Bornholm I North, Bornholm I South, and Bornholm II (referred
to as EIB1N, EIB1S and EIB2), by examining key parameters such as wake loss and foundation
costs. These parameters provides nuances and insight when determining what turbine is most
cost-effective and which site can achieve the lowest LCOE. Furthermore, the analysis investigates
the effect of a carbon tax on layout and LCOE.
The results show that increasing turbine size generally leads to lower LCOE, primarily due to
reduced wake losses and access to better wind resources at higher hub heights. Among the turbine
sizes tested, the 22 MW model consistently achieved the lowest LCOE at all sites, although the
marginal benefit diminished with each size increase. Compared to the 8 MW turbine, the 22 MW
turbine’s LCOE was up to 3.2% lower.
Layout patterns were found to prioritize maximizing energy production over minimizing foundation
costs, with turbines spaced further apart to reduce wake effects. Generally, this layout
tendency remained the same across turbine sizes, except for EIB2, which increasingly favored the
shallower waters with larger turbine sizes. EIB2’s lower capacity density (MW/km2) allowed for
turbines to be placed in shallow areas without incurring severe wake losses, while EIB1N and EIB1S
experienced greater wake losses due to higher capacity density. It was observed that the sites with
higher capacity density were also the sites with shallower waters. Despite these differences, all sites
showed similar LCOE values, indicating a balance between wake losses (linked to capacity density)
and foundation costs (linked to depth). However, EIB1S achieved the lowest overall LCOE, with
a value of 59.4 €/MWh.
The inclusion of a carbon tax of 16.8 €/tCO2e had a negligible effect on turbine layout while
slightly increasing LCOE by 0.3-0.4% corresponding to approximately 0.2 €/MWh. Overall, the
findings support the use of larger turbines for minimizing LCOE when moderate carbon tax is
considered.
However, it was observed that the carbon tax affects larger turbines more due to their mass
scaling, why a substantially higher tax would offset the benefits of larger turbines making them
less economically favorable. The turning point was found around 300 €/tCO2e where 15-22 MW
turbines achieve nearly identical LCOE.

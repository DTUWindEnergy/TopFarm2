Wind Farm Optimization Strategies
================================================================================

**Abstract**

The present project analyzes the consequences of making use of a model called ESM in a single wind
turbine and in the wind farm of HornsRev1. This model is based on the idea that extreme precipitation
events cause an erosion in the blade leading edge, forcing to repair the blade and to a loss in its aerodynamic
efficiency. The rotor tip speed has been proved to be a variable that influences the level of leading
edge erosion. In consequence, the project aims to optimize a rotor control system that reduces the tip
speed to a particular value as a function of the extreme precipitation events and the energy market price
at a specific moment. Three locations have been studied with two wind turbines with different technical
characteristics. The conclusions are in terms of the extra benefit and energy production that are obtained
by applying the ESM in contrast of not making use of this rotor control system.

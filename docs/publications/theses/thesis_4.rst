Discrete optimization for down selection of positions in offshore wind farm layouts
==========================================================================================

**Abstract**

Offshore wind farm design increasingly faces the challenge of adapting layouts to larger turbines
as technology advances. A promising approach is down-selection, where layouts designed
for smaller turbines are adapted to higher-rated machines by selecting a subset of positions.
This thesis investigates two central questions: which optimisation strategies are suitable for
the down-selection problem, and what is the impact of down-selection on the final wind farm
layout. The first question was addressed through a structured evaluation of candidate algorithms,
including a literature-based ranking, parameter tuning, and comparative testing across
multiple cases. The analysis showed that Gradient-Based methods and Greedy Heuristics were
the most effective strategies, with complementary strengths: Gradient-Based approaches offered
scalability and computational efficiency, while Greedy Heuristics achieved higher energy
yields under different occupancy conditions. The second question was addressed by comparing
down-selected farms with layouts directly optimised for larger turbines. Across all test cases,
the down-selected layouts achieved annual energy productions within 0.15% of the optimised
layouts, showing that down-selection can closely replicate optimal performance. The small
residual differences were governed primarily by spacing constraints, with compatibility between
initial and final requirements leading to near-lossless performance. Down-selection also
influenced turbine distribution, with more retained along site perimeters, which may affect secondary
design drivers such as cabling or support structures. Overall, the results demonstrate
that down-selection is a viable and efficient design strategy, provided that algorithm selection
and parameter tuning are carefully matched to the problem context, and that future spacing
requirements are anticipated at the design stage. These insights underline the potential of
down-selection to reduce computational and economic costs in wind farm development while
maintaining energy yield, and point towards its integration within robust design frameworks
for future turbine upgrades.

Cost optimization of catenary mooring for floating offshore wind farms using shared anchors with outlook to integration of this in farm design optimization
==========================================================================================================================================================================================================================

**Abstract**

In recent years Floating Offshore Wind Turbines(FOWT) are rapidly moving towards
commercial deployment of wind farm scale. With this an interesting mooring
concept with wind turbines sharing anchors are investigated for different depths
and turbine spacing. As the turbines share anchor, the footprint of the mooring(
horizontal distance from turbine to anchor) determines the turbine spacing.
The cost of station keeping is investigated for a range of different depths and turbine
spacing. It is found that cost of catenary mooring, with the same thickness
along the mooring line, varies significantly with turbine spacing. The greater the
depth, the greater the optimal turbine spacing gives the lowest cost of mooring
using shared anchors. Further it is found that the bigger the park, the greater
the effect of using shared anchors is. Depending on assumption, significant cost
savings are found. This investigation is also to serve as a foundation to be used in
layout optimization for FOWT parks.

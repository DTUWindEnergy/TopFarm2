Wind farm optimization to maximize AEP and energy density under loads constraints
===================================================================================

**Abstract**

Since the beginning of this decade, there has been an exponential growth in the number
of wind energy projects globally; by the year 2050, it is expected that wind energy will
produce 25 to 30 percent of the world’s electricity. Wind farms are expected to expand in
size and quantity under these circumstances. Energy density optimizations may be required
as wind farm sizes grow in the existing wind society, where most wind farm optimizations
are geared toward either optimizing Energy production or Economic considerations. This
thesis aims to find techniques to increase both the energy production and energy density of
wind farms. Two examples will be analyzed for this project, one with a tiny hypothetical
wind farm architecture and the other with an actual wind farm subject to fatigue load
restrictions. All layout optimizations are carried out with the help of the TOPFARM and
pywake packages from DTU. The optimizations’ results showed that wind farm layout with
high energy densities and equally good energy productions are possible.

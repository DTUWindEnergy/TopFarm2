    "Constraints are the second key element of an optimization problem formulation and they ensure that the optimization results represent feasible/realistic solutions. There are three types of constraints in optimization:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Variable bounds**: upper and lower boundary values for design variables.\n",
    "- **Inequality constraints**: constraint function values must be less or more than a given threshold.\n",
    "- **Equality constraints**: constraint function must be exactly equal to a value (not as commonly used).\n",
    "\n",
    "In TOPFARM, the two most common type of constraints are boundary (`XYBoundaryConstraint`) and spacing constraints (`SpacingConstraint`). The boundaries constraints restrict the wind farm within a defined region, where the turbines inside are not allowed to cross this boundary and any exclusion zone must be avoided. In addition, spacing constraints tell TOPFARM the minimum allowable inter-turbine spacing in the farm.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also the possibility of specifying additional constraints, such as fatigue loading or AEP. To do this, the **post_constraints** option in the TOPFARM problem is specified. More on how to set this up can be seen in the [load constrained layout optimization](https://topfarm.pages.windenergy.dtu.dk/TopFarm2/basic_examples_nblinks/layout_and_loads_nb.html) and [wake steering with load constraints](https://topfarm.pages.windenergy.dtu.dk/TopFarm2/advanced_examples_nblinks/wake_steering_and_loads_nb.html) examples.\n",

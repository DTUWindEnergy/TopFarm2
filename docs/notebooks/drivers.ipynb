    "The TOPFARM platform actually relies on the **OpenMDAO library**, an open-source platform which aims to build new analysis and optimization tools to be employed in a variety of mathematical and engineering problems. In particular, the word **\"driver\"** is an OpenMDAO technical term which refers to a series of instructions operating on a workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the simplest case, a driver can execute an entire workflow; in the case of optimization, a driver is usually an optimization procedure which operates over the workflow until (ideally) an optimal solution is found. When the problem has a particularly complex formulation, there may be multiple drivers acting on sub-groups of a workflow.  For instance, in an optimization under uncertainty (OUU) problem, there is usually an uncertainty quantification/analysis driver operating on a workflow nested within a larger optimization workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial provides a basic introduction to the application of openMDAO drivers in the optimization of wind farm design as solved by TOPFARM. Such drivers can be based both on iterative step-by-step algorithms or metaheuristic/heuristic algorithms; in particular this tutorial will focus on:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Design Of Experiments (DOE)**: these drivers sample across a set of input parameters and execute the workflow for each input set. Such drivers can be parallelized easily since each workflow execution is independent from the next.\n",
    "2. **Gradient-Based or Local-Search optimizers**: these drivers are *iterative algorithms* which use the information on the gradients of the objective function with respect to the design variables in order to explore the design space systematically and find an improved design. This class of drivers is efficient, but still challenged by problems that contain significant nonconvexity, by objective functions that are relatively insensitive to the design variables, and by other issues.\n",
    "3. **Gradient-Free optimization algorithms**: these drivers are *iterative algorithms* which aim to optimize the objective function under the given constraints assuming that the gradient is unknown. Such methodes usually assign to the objective function an arbitrary score to be minimized or maximised depending on the algorithm specifications.\n",
    "4. **Gradient-Free Metaheuristic optimizers**: these drivers typically use *nature-inspired algorithms* to search the design space more globally. They use, or even combine, multiple design instances at once and compare their performances to make decisions about how to generate new designs that hopefully improve the objective function. A classic example of this type of optimizer is the *Genetic Algorithm*.\n",
    "5. **Gradient-Free Heuristic optimizers**: these drivers use some sort of heuristic to search through the design space that is informed by domain knowledge and experience with some element of randomness as well. For example, *Random-Search algorithms* fall into this category and are widely used in commercial wind farm optimization. Heuristic optimizers differ from Metaheuristic ones as they are not \"problem-specific\", indeed, they are developed without making any assumption about the optimization they are going to solve.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For those interested, further information on the optimization drivers available in OpenMDAO are available at [here](https://openmdao.org/newdocs/versions/latest/_srcdocs/packages/drivers/doe_driver.html). Next, we will introduce a specific example of each of the aforementioned driver types applied to a TOPFARM optimization problem."

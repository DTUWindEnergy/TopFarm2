Development Workflow
=======================

A fan brush is a fantastic piece of equipment.
Use it.
Make friends with it.
Go out on a limb - that's where the fruit is.



Branching vs. forking
---------------------


I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us.
This is the fun part.
This is your world.
Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy.
Trees cover up a multitude of sins.
We'll paint one happy little tree right here.


Merging to master
-----------------

Isn't that fantastic that you can create an almighty tree that fast?
We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck.
Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it.
We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy.
We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world.


GitLab and GitHub
-----------------

Decide where your cloud lives. Maybe he lives right in here.
The little tiny Tim easels will let you down.
Here's something that's fun. If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness.


Issue tracking
--------------

But they're very easily killed.
Clouds are delicate.
Go out on a limb - that's where the fruit is.
Now it's beginning to make a little sense.
You have to make these big decisions.
In painting, you have unlimited power.
You have the ability to move mountains. You can bend rivers.
But when I get home, the only thing I have power over is the garbage.
That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington.

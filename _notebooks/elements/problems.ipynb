    "In Topfarm the problem is the collection/container of components and drivers. Optimizing a problem is executing a workflow - finding the best feasible solution under a series of constraints using a specific driver, and initial conditions. To the problem is also attached a plotting routine so one can follow the optimization path as well as a recorder so that intermediate variable values are accessible after the optimization is finished. The Topfarm Problem inherits its fundamental nature from the OpenMDAO problem, and is being adapted so it can connect the given workflow with the driver. For example if the user specifies a boundary constraint and this is not supported by the driver, the Problem is equipped with a penalty component that will deter the driver giving unfeasible solutions. Or if your workflow does not have gradients for all components and a gradient based driver is specified, finite differencing is applied to obtain the gradients. "
